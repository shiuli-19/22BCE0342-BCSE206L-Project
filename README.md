# GSS7402 Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes data from the **General Social Survey (GSS)** collected between **1974 and 2002**.  
The dataset (`GSS7402`) contains demographic, social, and economic information about individuals in the United States.  
The analysis explores how factors such as education, income background, ethnicity, and immigration status relate to **family size**, **age at first birth**, and **social mobility**.

## Objective
The primary objectives of this analysis are:
- To investigate how education levels correlate with the number of children.  
- To analyze the influence of low-income background and immigrant status on family outcomes.  
- To examine trends over time in average education and fertility rates.  
- To study how socioeconomic background at age 16 affects age at first birth.

## Dataset Description
The **GSS7402 dataset** contains approximately **9,120 cross-sectional observations** from the General Social Survey (1974–2002).

### Variables
| Variable | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| rownames | Record identifier |
| kids | Number of children |
| age | Respondent’s age (in years) |
| education | Years of formal education completed |
| year | Survey year |
| siblings | Number of siblings |
| agefirstbirth | Age at first birth (missing for those without children) |
| ethnicity | Self-reported ethnicity (binary variable) |
| city16 | Lived in a city at age 16 (Yes/No) |
| lowincome16 | Low-income household at age 16 (Yes/No) |
| immigrant | Immigrant status (Yes/No) |

## Key Findings and Conclusion
- Individuals with **higher education** tend to have **fewer children**, suggesting education influences family planning decisions.  
- Those from **low-income households at age 16** tend to have **children earlier** in life.  
- **Immigrants** show a slightly **higher average number of children** compared to non-immigrants.  
- Minor variations exist in **education and family size across ethnic groups**.  
- From **1974 to 2002**, the average education level increased while the average number of children declined.

**Conclusion:**  
Education and early-life socioeconomic conditions strongly influence family size and reproductive behavior, highlighting the social and economic factors that shape demographic patterns over time.
